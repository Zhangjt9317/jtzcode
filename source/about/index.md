## About Me

I gained my bachelor degree from Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and went to University of Washington (UW) for master degree in chemical engineering, I was working on the the application of data science on material development and renewable energy, and that was the time I found how much data has changed our modern life. 

This is my personal blog and I will write tech blogs here, I want to practice more here so it will not be awkward writing in other major tech blogs like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/). 

If there are any questions please write comments and I will reply in time. Thank you.
