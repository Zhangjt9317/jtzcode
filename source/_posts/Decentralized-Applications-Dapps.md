# Introduction 

***Decentralized applications (Dapps) are digital applications or programs that run on a blockchain or a P2P network of computers instead of a single computer***

Decentralized applications communicate with the blockchain, which manages the state of all network actors. The interface looks no different to centralized applications, but both the front-end and back-end systems are all decentralized. The smart contract represents the core logic of a Dapp, and they are building blocks of blockchains, processing information from external sources to help the blockchain management the state of all network actors. 


## Dapps vs. centralized apps

To better understand how Dapps differ from conventional apps, consider an app that also has 3 traits:

* can't be shut down, runs forever
* no downtime
* are more secure against cyberattacks
* not owned by anyone

These are promising features of Dapps that can potentially change the way that we work, communicate, commute, and even reshape the web.

Here are some of the critical benefits of Dapps:

* Removing transaction fees;
* Users can retain control of their data;
* Open-source;
* Since there is no central place to hack, they reduce massive data breaches;
* Censorship-proof;
* Can accept cryptocurrency as payment;
* Can generate income for users;
* No central authority or monopoly;
* Readily scalable.

They can all be categorized into 3 main benefits:

* open-source 
* trackable 
* immutable (or we can say relatively immutable)

## Future of Dapps

Dapps bring tremendous changes in many industries, such as supply chain, health care, education, finance, and others. It has the power to upgrade traditional management sytem to a better, more humane and efficient one. 



## Hands-on Dapp Creation

Here I will give an introduction to making some of Dapps using web dev knowledge. Udacity provides the Blockchain Development Nanodegree that teaches you about blockchain dev and how to construct your own Dapps.
