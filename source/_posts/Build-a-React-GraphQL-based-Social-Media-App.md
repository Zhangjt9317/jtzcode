## Introduction and App Demo

This post is a summary and writeup for the video [React / GraphQL Course - Build a social media app (MERNG Stack)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1mdAPFq2Os) from freecodecamp. 

While, spending nearly 6 hours watching the entire thing, though you can speed it up, is tiresome and tedious. So I summarize what I learned by writing.

**Thanks for freecodecamp for providing so many useful resources for programmers, you guys are the best**

## GraphQL explained + tech used

![graphql](graphql.png)

REST API uses HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT and DELTE) to perform CRUD operations in JSON format, fllowing better and faster parsing of data.

However, there are downsides:

1. It fetches all data, whether required or not (over-fetching)
2. It makes multiple network requests to get multiple resources 
3. Sometimes resources are dependent on each other, causing waterfall network requests 

Facebook developed GraphQL to overcome those issues. There is 1 main endpoint, fewer opeartions and serve document APIs in GraphQL, and that is the primary advantage. 


* What is GraphQL
  * A query language 
  * Can be used on top of any backend 
  * Queries, Mutations (and Subscriptions)
  * Standardised specification 

In this project, we will be using the MERNG tech stack:

* MongoDB (Atlas)
* Express
* React
* Node.js
* GraphQL (Apollo)

### Installation 

1. Node.js 
2. MongoDB Atlas (choose your region) ==> free cluster

In MongoDB Atlas, create a free cluster with name, and add a database user with username `classed` and autogenerated password **(you will need it so save it somewhere)**. 

Go to the `IP Access List` and make sure the IP Address is `0.0.0.0/0`, which allows access from anywhere.

## Server Demonstration 

After installation, create a new folder and create `.gitignore` and `index.js` by using `touch` command in `git`. Then you can run `npm init -y` to initialize npm env in the folder. 

Install `apollo-server`, `graphql` and `mongoose` by running

```[Bash]
npm install apollo-server graphql mongoose
```

After this, go to `index.js` and type the following:

```[Javascript]
const {ApolloServer} = require('apollo-server');
const gql = require("graphql-tag");

const typeDefs = gql`
    type Query{
        sayHi: String!
    }
`

const resolvers = {
    Query:{
        sayHi: () => 'Hello World!'
    }
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs, 
    resolvers
});

server.listen({port: 5000}).then(res =>{
    console.log(`Server running at ${res.url}`)
})

```

Get GraphQL and ApolloServer from the installed pacakge and set up the apollo server by running `node index` in the terminal. The port should be `5000`. 

You will see an Apollo server playground after opening the url. Typing 

```[Javascript]
query{
    sayHi
}
```

and you will see the following

![apollo](apollo-server.png)


Here you can find `docs` and `schema` tabs on the right side. 


## Setting Up Databases & Server 

1. Connect You Application on MongoDB

    From the previous code, import mongoose and connect to MongoDB by clicking on `connect` and click `connect your application`. 

    Copy and past the link (use `Node` Driver) and change `<dbname>` to `test` for test. Use the autogenerated password you saved early. 

    **Remember you can create a mongodb database and change `<dbname>` to that later**

2. Build a Data Model
    In the root directory, create a folder called `models`, and create `User.js` and `Post.js`. 

    In `User.js`, import `mongoose` and create a `userSchema`:

    ```[Javascript]
    const { model, Schema } = require("mongoose");

    const userSchema = new Schema({
    username: String,
    password: String,
    email: String,
    createdAt: String,
    });

    module.exports = model("User", userSchema);
    ```

    In `Post.js`, build a `postShema` with `body`, `username`, `createdAt`, `comments`, `likes` and `user`. 

    The `user` should refer to `User.js` by using `Schema.Types.ObjectId` with `ref: 'users'`. 

    Both `User.js` and `Post.js` should be exported as modules and imported into `index.js`. 


3. Import Modules and getPosts

    From the previous code, we import `Post.js` as `Post` and modify `gql` types and `resolvers` to fetch all posts from sample document we just created. 


    After modifications, the code right now should look like this:
   
    ```[Javascript]
    const {ApolloServer} = require('apollo-server');
    const gql = require("graphql-tag");
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

    const {MONGODB} = require('./config.js');
    const Post = require("./models/Post"); // import Post here

    // build a new type called Post and change Query action to getPosts
    const typeDefs = gql`
        type Post {
            id: ID!
            body: String!
            createdAt: String!
            username: String!
        }
        type Query {
            getPosts: [Post]
        }
    `

    const resolvers = {
        // build a async request because network could be offline
        Query:{
            async getPosts(){
                try{
                    const posts = await Post.find(); //find all posts
                    return posts
                } catch(err){
                    throw new Error(err);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    const server = new ApolloServer({
        typeDefs, 
        resolvers
    });

    mongoose
        .connect(MONGODB, {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
        .then(() =>{
            console.log(`MongoDB Connected`);
            return server.listen({port: 5000});
        }).then((res) => {
            console.log(`Server running at ${res.url}`);
        });
    ```


4. Create a Sample Document 

    Go to MongoDB Atlas `Collections` and `INSERT DOCUMENT`. Create a sample document as the following:

    ![sample doc](insert_post_mongo.png)

5. Get All Posts from Mongoose

    Running `node index` in the terminal to update the port and run again

    ![get_post](get_post.png)
