## Introduction 


One of the main resource I used is the book written by Douglas C. Montgomery: Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

A lot of examples in finance will be introduced, since it is related to my current work. 



## Statistics Background and Forecasting 



## Regression Analysis 



## Exponential Smoothing Methods




## ARIMA Models 




## Transfer Functions and Intervection Models




## Other Models 

1. Multivariate Times Series Models and Forecasting 
2. State Space Models 
3. ARCH and GARCH models
4. Direct Forecasting of Percentiles
5. Combining Forecasts to Improve Prediction Performance 
6. Aggregation and Disaggregation of Forecasts 
7. Neural Neetworks and Forecasting 

### ARCH and GARCH Models 

In the standard regression and time series models, many diagnostic checks are based on the assumptions we imposed on the errors:

* independent 
* identically distributed with zero mean
* constant variance
